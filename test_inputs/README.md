# Test Inputs Directory

This directory is for storing test input images and sample data for the constellation detection system.

## Purpose

Place sample astronomical images or synthetic test data files here for testing and debugging purposes.

## Usage

If you have test images to use with the demo script, you can:

1. Place them in this directory
2. Modify `demo_detection.py` or create a new script to load images from this directory
3. Run detection and visualization on them

## File Organization

- **Input images**: Place any test images here (e.g., `sample_starfield.jpg`, `test_constellation.png`)
- **Synthetic templates**: Configuration files for generating synthetic test data
- **Ground truth data**: Expected results for validation (if applicable)
