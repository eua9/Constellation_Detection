**Project Title:** Constellation Detection

**Team Member:** Ryan Mitchell

**Description:** 
This project aims to automatically detect constellations in astronomical images by
identifying star patterns and matching them to known constellation templates. The goal is to
create a system capable of recognizing constellations despite variations in scale, rotation, noise,
and partial visibility.


**Dataset:** 
We will utilize publicly available star field images from sources such as NASA, ESA, or
Kaggle’s star datasets. If necessary, additional synthetic star maps will be created by plotting
cataloged star coordinates from open databases such as the Hipparcos Catalog and the Bright
Star Catalog.


**Proposed Method:** 
The pipeline consists of three main stages.
First, star detection will be performed using thresholding or blob detection techniques to extract
star centroids.

Second, a star graph will be constructed by computing pairwise distances and normalizing star
patterns using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to ensure rotation and scale invariance.
Finally, constellation identification will be achieved by comparing the extracted star graphs
against stored templates using methods such as Procrustes analysis, Hausdorff distance, or
graph matching. This approach incorporates fundamental concepts such as segmentation,
clustering, PCA, template matching, and classical computer vision tools, implemented with
OpenCV and NumPy.

If necessary, additional synthetic star maps will be generated by plotting cataloged star
coordinates from open databases such as the Hipparcos Catalog or the Bright Star Catalog.
